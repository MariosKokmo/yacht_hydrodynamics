A simple analysis on the Yacht Hydrodynamics dataset found on UCI repository.

The Delft data set comprises 308 full-scale experiments, which were performed at the Delft Ship Hydromechanics Laboratory for that purpose. 
These experiments include 22 different hull forms. The goal is to predict Residuary resistance per unit weight of displacement based on the other 6 features.
