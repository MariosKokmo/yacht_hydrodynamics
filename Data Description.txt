What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent?

Variations concern hull geometry coefficients and the Froude number:

1. Longitudinal position of the center of buoyancy, adimensional.
2. Prismatic coefficient, adimensional.
3. Length-displacement ratio, adimensional.
4. Beam-draught ratio, adimensional.
5. Length-beam ratio, adimensional.
6. Froude number, adimensional.

The measured variable is the residuary resistance per unit weight of displacement:

7. Residuary resistance per unit weight of displacement, adimensional.


Additional Information

Prediction of residuary resistance of sailing yachts at the initial design stage is of a great value for evaluating the shipâ€™s performance and for estimating the required propulsive power. Essential inputs include the basic hull dimensions and the boat velocity. 

The Delft data set comprises 308 full-scale experiments, which were performed at the Delft Ship Hydromechanics Laboratory for that purpose. 
These experiments include 22 different hull forms, derived from a parent form closely related to the â€˜Standfast 43â€™ designed by Frans Maas.
